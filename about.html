                Hello, my name is Honey! I have always loved making wonderful things with paper,
                and that's what encouraged me to make this website. Here, you can find an 
                extensive list of various origami designs.

                Origami is the art of paper folding, often associated with Japanese culture. The 
                goal is to transform a flat square sheet of paper into a finished sculpture 
                through folding and sculpting techniques. The small number of basic origami folds
                can be combined in a variety of ways to make intricate designs. The best-known
                origami model is the Japanese paper crane.
